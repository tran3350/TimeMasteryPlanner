Time Management Planner
=======================

This project introduces a time management planner that assists users in effectively organizing their tasks and study sessions. The program provides the functionality to plan and track tasks, allocate breaks, and manage their time efficiently.

Features
--------
- **DayPlanner Class:** Enables users to plan tasks for specific days, including setting the day of the week, date, year, and task description.

- **PlannedDay Class:** Allows users to group tasks for an entire week, providing a convenient way to manage tasks based on different days and weeks.

Usage
-----
1. Run the `Main.java` file to interact with the time management planner.
2. The program showcases the scheduling of tasks and breaks using the Pomodoro technique.
3. Users can input task names, the number of chunks (study/break cycles), and the time allotted for each task.
4. The program calculates and displays the distribution of tasks and breaks for each session.

Example
-------
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage of the time management planner
        // ...
    }
}

Note

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a time management planner using the Pomodoro technique. Users can input their task details and receive a structured study session plan with breaks.

Feel free to experiment and enhance the project to match your time management needs!
